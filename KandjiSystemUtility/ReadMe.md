# Kandji System Utility Demo

This app is a typical MVC app (Model = datasource; View = displaying the data from the model; Controller = one view controller with the three views). I'm also very accustomed to doing other architectures such as MVVM, MVVP, etc. 

Three to four hours of work here and lots of places to do polishing, I wish I had the extra time to make things even more Swifty!

But I had enough fun just porting some Objective-C low level system code over to Swift.

## Things I'd love to do:

1) make the three segments totally resizeable (the first and second sections are fixed heights)

2) put something useful in the headerview of the cpu usage, or switch the progress indicators to level indicators with colors, like as in the disk usage view.
